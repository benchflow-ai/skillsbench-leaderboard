/**
 * Community Skill Leaderboard — types + dataset descriptor.
 *
 * See docs/skill-leaderboard-design.md. The board ranks USER-SUBMITTED skills
 * by the lift they give an agent on the SkillsBench suite. It is the
 * skill-centric sibling of the agent board in `leaderboard-data.ts` and reuses
 * the same lift math (`delta`, normalized gain `g`).
 *
 * Submission model: the author uploads the skill bundle, TWO trajectories
 * (their agent solving the suite without / with the skill) and their per-task
 * scores. The claimed lift is published IMMEDIATELY with
 * `attestation: "self-reported"` — rendered grey and unranked. An owned worker
 * then REPLAYS both trajectories in the sealed task containers, runs the
 * verifiers, and replaces the row in place with `attestation: "replayed"` —
 * the only tier whose numbers come from our verification and the only tier
 * that is ranked. The skill SOURCE, trajectories and per-task scores stay
 * private (`visibility: "private"`); only the score + a run manifest are
 * published. The website is a pure consumer of the published snapshot
 * (`skill-leaderboard.json`), exactly like the agent board.
